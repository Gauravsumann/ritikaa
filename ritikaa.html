        <title>PLAGIARISM</title>
        <strong>
            <h1>WHAT IS PLAGIARISM?</h1>
            <p>Plagiarism is derived from the latin word "plagiarius" meaning "kidnapper". Plagarism means stealling or copying another's work and representing it as own work .on internet ,everything is availabel for free. we can share,upload,download,view or search any text,audio,video.everything is there for free. the availability of anything and everything on the internet has made our life easierbut people missuse of this advantage of the internet by representing other's workas their own for fame, for academic benifits,for money,for personal interest,etc </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Type of PLAGIARISM</h1>
            <p>There are several types of plagarism</p>
            <p>Complete Plagiarism: Complete Plagiarism is the most extreme form of plagiarism. In this plagiarism, a
                person completely copies someone else’s work such as a research paper, article, image, etc, and
                represents it as their own work. This form of plagiarism is similar to identity theft or stealing.</p>
                <p>Verbatim: Verbatim is also known as direct plagiarism. When we read a book we must have observed
                    that if any statement that a famous person has made is always represented in double quotations and is
                    highlighted so that we get to know that it is said by this particular person. Similarly consider a person
                    writing an article and mentioning someone’s else work or words that too exactly the same. But this
                    person doesn’t represent it in quotation marks. Then that person is said to be exhibiting direct
                    plagiarism. Hence copying another person’s work word to word and not representing it in quotation
                    marks is known as Verbatim or direct plagiarism.</p>
                    <p>Self Plagiarism: This kind of plagiarism is the duplication of a person’s own work. It is also known as auto
                        plagiarism. It occurs when a person copies some words of his own published work and uses the same for
                        another work. This form of plagiarism is commonly observed in research journals. Researchers may
                        make re-use of their research work for another research work, however, the percentage of re-usage
                        must be according to those set by the publishing journals if they allow them to do so.</p>
                        <p>Source-Based Plagiarism: This form of plagiarism is most commonly observed in research work. In the
                            research paper one needs to provide references that have contributed to their work, If a person
                            provides wrong references that do not exist, or that are not relating to the work then it is known as
                            source-based plagiarism. The falsification of data or its fabrication is also source-based plagiarism.
                            Falsification and fabrication of data are manipulating or representing false or non-existing data.</p>
                            <p>Accidental Plagiarism: This kind of plagiarism mostly occurs due to a lack of knowledge. If we don’t know
                                how to paraphrase, cite and quote a research work we leave the work as it is and it results in accidental
                                plagiarism.</p>
